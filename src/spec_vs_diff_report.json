  "summary": "The diff implements backend initialization with default container types and sizes, migration logic for existing data, and frontend dropdown population with proper validation. However, several acceptance criteria are not fully verifiable due to truncated content, and some implementation details differ from specifications.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-164",
      "requirement": "Container sizes must have height_ft dimensions matching 8.5 and 9.5 as specified (20ft: 8.5, 40ft standard: 8.5, 40ft high cube: 9.5, 45ft high cube: 9.5)",
      "reason": "Migration.mo shows height_ft values of 8 and 9 instead of 8.5 and 9.5. The specification clearly states height=8.5 for standard containers and height=9.5 for high cube containers, but the implementation uses integer values 8 and 9.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-169",
      "requirement": "Error toast notifications must display when API calls fail for useContainerTypes and useContainerSizes hooks",
      "reason": "useQueries.ts shows useContainerTypes and useContainerSizes hooks with retry: 3 and staleTime configuration, but no explicit onError handlers with toast.error() calls are visible in the truncated code, unlike other mutations (e.g., useCreateProductionEntry) that do include toast.error() handlers.",
